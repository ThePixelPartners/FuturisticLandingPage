You are a senior front-end engineer and designer. Your task is to generate a **fully responsive** landing page that **exactly follows** the layout, typography, color palette, and spacing of the Canva “Parallel” template at https://12989252e22342.my.canva.site/parallel-website. Use modern HTML5, semantic tags, and CSS3 (Tailwind CSS if available, otherwise plain CSS with Flexbox/Grid). Include minimal JavaScript only for interactivity (e.g. mobile nav toggle, testimonial carousel).

**Requirements:**

1. **Global Styles & Setup**
   - Use the same gradient background on the hero (exact color stops from the Canva example).
   - Base font: ‘Montserrat’ for headings, ‘Open Sans’ for body text (import via Google Fonts).
   - Define a consistent spacing scale (e.g. 1rem, 1.5rem, 2rem).
   - Set up a mobile-first responsive grid.

2. **Header & Navigation**
   - Place a transparent header over the hero; on scroll it turns solid white with a subtle shadow.
   - Logo on the left (use placeholder SVG), nav links on the right. On screens <768px collapse into a hamburger menu with slide-in drawer.

3. **Hero Section**
   - Full viewport height.
   - Split layout: left side text block (headline, subheading, primary CTA button), right side hero image (use a high-res placeholder).
   - Headline size, line-height, and letter-spacing matching the example.
   - Button style: rounded pill, hover transition, shadow.

4. **Feature Highlights**
   - Three equal-width cards in a row: each with icon (SVG placeholder), title, short description.
   - Card background white, fully rounded corners, center-aligned content, hover lift effect.

5. **Content Blocks (Alternate Layouts)**
   - Two sections that alternate image/text alignment.
     - Section A: image left, text right.
     - Section B: text left, image right.
   - Match padding, image aspect ratio, and headline/paragraph styling.

6. **Testimonials**
   - A 3-item carousel or staggered grid on a soft pastel background.
   - Each testimonial includes user avatar (circular), quote text, and name/title.
   - Include prev/next controls or dots for carousel.

7. **Call-to-Action Banner**
   - Full-width colored strip with a concise message and a secondary CTA button.

8. **Footer**
   - Dark background, white text.
   - Four columns: quick links, resources, social icons, newsletter signup form.
   - Include form with email input and submit button.

9. **Accessibility & SEO**
   - All images get `alt` attributes.
   - Buttons and links have `aria-labels` where needed.
   - Include `<meta>` tags for viewport, description, and Open Graph (use placeholder values).

10. **Output**
    - Provide `index.html`, `styles.css` (and `tailwind.config.js` if using Tailwind), and any small `script.js`.
    - Comment each major section clearly.
    - Ensure the final page looks pixel-perfect compared to the Canva example, and works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Start by analyzing the Canva URL’s design details (colors, fonts, spacing, component shapes), then generate the complete codebase.
